Answer the following questions:
1. Let’s define an ordering of similar pool implementations based on concurrency properties,
from less concurrent to more concurrent:
• Not thread safe.
• Lock-free single producer single consumer (SPSC).
• Lock-free multiple producer single consumer (MPSC).
• Lock-free multiple producer multiple consumer (MPMC).
Consider only the calls to Rent and Return. Forget about Dispose for this analysis.
Which category does the given implementation belong to and why?

2. What changes would you make to move the implementation to the next category (or the 
previous category if already MPMC)?


3. What is the purpose of Implementation._previousImplementation?
